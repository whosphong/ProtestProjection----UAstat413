# ProtestProjection----UAstat413

*This project is apart of the Statistic 413 class of W2024 @ the University of Alberta under Dr. Adam Kashlak*

Given a data samples of statstics related to Canadian population based on geography, students are to determine how to predict future protest in the year 2025. Students are given free range on how to conduct this project whether it be seasonal protest, month, or annual and 
 what statistical model they used to conduct such prediction. They were also allowed to add variables or delete then and must show capability of critical thinking on finding a solution rather than getting a correct one.

In this project, we use many statistical methods to predict the number of protests that will happen in 2025 using the data provided. First, we begin by figuring out which factors are important for predicting protests by testing them via a method called parametric bootstrapping. Then, we will begin to use another method called Monte Carlo to make a 95% prediction interval about how many protests we might see. By doing this, we hope to make a good estimate of future protests and help us prepare for what might happen in 2025.
